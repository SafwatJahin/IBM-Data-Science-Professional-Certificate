# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! This repository contains all the projects and assignments I've completed as part of this certificate program. Below, you'll find descriptions of each project and how it relates to the skills I've developed throughout the course.

## Projects:

1. **Data Science Methodology**: This project explores the methodology used in data science projects, including problem understanding, data preparation, data understanding, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

2. **Python for Data Science and AI**: In this project, I've applied Python programming skills for data science tasks, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

3. **Data Analysis with Python**: Here, I've utilized Python to analyze and visualize data. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and drawing insights from data using statistical methods.

4. **Data Visualization with Python**: This project focuses on creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

5. **Machine Learning with Python**: In this project, I've implemented various machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, to solve real-world problems.

6. **Applied Data Science Capstone**: The capstone project is the culmination of the certificate program. Here, I've tackled a real-world problem using the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course. This includes problem definition, data collection, data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
